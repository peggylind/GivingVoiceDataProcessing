# Giving Voice Data Processing

This is the code development done to process articles and create basic stats and topicmodels.

## Getting Started

The code is controlled by the `main.R` script which will load all required functions from other R scripts located in the scripts folder.

Make sure you have have data folders for the articles (e.g. inside a folder called "Data_clean") and for the secondary sources (e.g. in "Secondary").


## Code Development

There is second script called main_testing.R that can be modified for testing purposes.
