Had Geneva truly been an attempt to resolve the Syrian stalemate influential nations would have insisted on the regimes adherence to the basic recommendations of the Geneva I talks in 2012 including the provision of humanitarian aid the release of prisoners of conscience and the cessation of Assads relentless air strikes on civilians These have continued to be a basic demand of the opposition but since Geneva I Assad has increased his assault and even imposed new draconian blockades on the most helpless of people in Syrias major cities including the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk In greater Damascus Homs and Aleppo people are starving to death as the world watches 
Assad believes he has time on his side With the political financial and military backing of powerful global actors such as Russia and Iran and with the reluctance of the US and its allies to engage in more than vapid condemnations or declarations of intent he can continue to terrorise most of the population into submission Simultaneously the regime can allow itself to be engaged in an endless process  or so it hopes For its part the opposition Syrian National Coalition came to Geneva under duress after warnings that even the meagre nonlethal aid provided by western countries would dry up if it refused to participate in what most Syrians opposed to Assad believe is an elaborate charade Expectations were not really low they were nonexistent 
Nevertheless the diplomatic process has delivered some surprises For one the Syrian regimes delegation exasperated even its Russian backer with belligerent statements and a disrespectful flouting of the meetings protocol In contrast the president of the national coalition Ahmad Jarba was rational and constructive impressing even the most sceptical of watchers Most importantly for the international community and Syrians of all persuasions the meeting proved a few points First by agreeing to the process the Assad regime has recognised that there is a formal organised opposition and that the uprising is not the global conspiracy or the terrorist invasion it has always claimed 
Second by discussing issues such as prisoner exchanges the regime has recognised that this opposition is the only political entity capable of coordinating with the Free Syrian Army and that the foreign Islamist factions in Syria therefore have no relation with either the opposition or the Free Syrian Army On these fronts the Syrian regimes propaganda has been exposed and the national coalition has managed to call the regimes bluff demonstrating more political maturity than many expected Even those antiAssad activists who are notoriously critical of the formal opposition have been generally supportive of its delegation to Switzerland 
But if this toothless process goes on for months if not years the regime will continue to pound the country Meanwhile the rebels will continue to fight back not only against Assads forces but against Isis Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant brigades as well which have been left to roam unhindered and even encouraged by Assad Regardless of the propaganda the fact remains that the vast majority of rebels took up arms against Assad to join defecting soldiers who refused to turn their weapons on the population Once Assad is gone there is no reason to believe that these soldiers will not go back to being regular soldiers and that civilians will not go back to rebuilding their lives with the help of the increasingly confident civil society organisations that continue to carve a socioeconomic and political role in the midst of all this destruction 
The worst thing the international community could do is push talks for the sake of talks to wash its hands of the problem that is Syria Leaving the catastrophe to sort itself out in Genevas corridors while continuing to refuse more direct engagement merely empowers Assad in the long run and pushes his opponents further into a zerosum calculation Geneva would then be doing more harm than good to Syria leaving Assad and his followers with the delusions that he is invincible and an irreplaceable partner in Syria 
With the immensity and the monstrosity of the crimes he has committed against the entire nation including the minorities he purports to protect it beggars belief that anyone could push for a solution that would keep Assad in power even partly even temporarily It is up to the international community to ensure that Geneva doesnt remain a mere process if it is serious as most Syrians are about ending the war Rime Allaf is a Syrian writer and researcher"
