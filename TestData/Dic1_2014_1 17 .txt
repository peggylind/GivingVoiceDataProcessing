He was a whiteskinned man and he had a huge cross tattooed right across his back Hakim Yaseen the local commander said It turned out that he was a Ukrainian Then I checked the other prisoners Among 90 foreigners were a white 43yearold British Muslim convert a BritishBritish sniper who could barely speak any Arabic and three British citizens of Moroccan origin We also had a white German an ArabAmerican an Albanian and a man from Brazil The fate of these men along with scores of other foreign jihadist prisoners now captive in rebel hands in northern Syria is posing a legal conundrum to Western countries and the Syrian opposition alike 
The prisoners including an unknown tally of British nationals have been captured during fighting between ISIS and a mainstream alliance of rebel groups that has resulted in more than 1000 deaths in the past three weeks Yet Syrian opposition officials say that the possibility of extraditing the prisoners to their parent nations is obstructed by legal problems related to the inability of Western countries to officially recognise rebel groups as legal entities Instead many now face possible trial by local courts in rebel territory 
Louay Mekdad of the Free Syrian Army FSA confirmed the opposition was seeking Western legal advice to put the men on trial in Syria Im trying to ask lawyers in the West how we can establish temporary courts for them he said Governments in the West say there is no process for now to move any foreign prisoner from FSA hands to outside Syria as they dont recognise the FSA as government So were asking for help from the West with courts Most have committed crimes cut heads and even burnt people alive They did a lot of crimes and should be tried 
At least 300 ISIS fighters predominantly foreign are believed to have been taken captive by the rebels in northern Syria since January 3 Most are Gulf Arabs but the number includes many Europeans An FSA major on the Supreme Military Council speaking on condition of anonymity said that several British nationals had been discovered among 170 ISIS prisoners taken during fighting in Aleppo Britons loyal to ISIS are now regarded as a major security threat to the UK and are the focus of a security crackdown that has resulted in at least 16 arrests in Britain this month At least 300 British citizens are thought to have travelled to Syria to fight with ISIS 
Rival Syrian rebel groups joined forces to fight ISIS in early January after it attempted to seize an FSA base in the town of Atarib near Aleppo It was one provocation too many with many rebels believing that the alQaedalinked group has had little part in fighting the regime concentrating instead on the brutal consolidation of its Islamic state pretensions in areas already captured by the FSA The torture and murder by ISIS of a local rebel commander pushed tensions to breaking point Retributive massacres have followed in the various towns or cities taken by ISIS in one Jarabulus the severed heads of rebel fighters were mounted on the walls of a cultural centre 
Photographs and video footage shown to The Times by activists and rebels in southern Turkey offered a glimpse of a savage struggle in which teenage fighters and women have played an active role One video clip showed the body of a Tunisian woman suicide bomber shot in the head near an FSA checkpoint outside Azaz Others showed prisoners slaughtered in ISIS jails From Tal Rifat pictures showed at least five ISIS child combatants including the young son of a Saudi jihadist The outcome of the fighting is further complicated by divisions among the rebels as to how to deal with ISIS prisoners Some groups favour putting them on trial while others prefer to use them in prisoner exchanges 
I received an envoy last week an FSA fighter who spoke English asking me if I would accept money if I released my BritishBritish prisoner to him said Hakim Yaseen I didnt accept Yet in Tal Rifat a captured Bosnian fighter from ISIS Abu Mohammed alBosni was filmed at liberty having pledged allegiance to Jabhat alNusra the homegrown affiliate of alQaeda still widely popular in Syria Jabhat alNusras rehabilitation of the Bosnian included the return of his Balkan wife under a truce arranged across nearby frontlines despite Mr alBosni being implicated in the deaths of six protesters shot by ISIS in Azaz 
Hakim Yaseen once a personal friend of the infamous Chechen ISIS field commander Abu Omar alShishani was asked if he remembered the day two years ago when he explained his acceptance of radical foreign fighters as rebel allies with the words well eat with the Devil if we need to He shrugged Weve learnt a lot since then AlShishani was my friend but if I saw him now with a gun Id kill him A fight between former friends is the worst of all They really know how to hurt each other
