Activists inside Homs said that about 200 women and children those suffering the worst as a result of the lack of food and medical supplies because of the army siege were ready to be evacuated from the area which has been cut off since June 2012 Those willing to leave would only do so if there are guarantees they wont be detained by the regime Many others do not want to leave their husbands behind said Abu Ziad an activist in the besieged area The shelling is still nonstop Many houses are on fire People are still getting killed 
In recent days rebels have posted footage on the internet showing devastated streets and residents apparently collecting grass and weeds to eat The United States is backing rebel demands that Red Cross aid convoys be allowed into the besieged area which is thought to contain up to 3000 people We firmly believe that the Syrian regime must approve the convoys to deliver badly needed humanitarian assistance into the Old City of Homs now said a State Department spokesman 
The situation is desperate and the people are starving Robert Mardini a Red Cross representative said the organisation was ready to deliver aid to Homs but only if it received consent and security guarantees from all sides He said that under humanitarian law none of the inhabitants could be forced to leave Red Cross lorries were fired on the last time they ventured into the city in June 2012 The impasse threatened to undo the only sign of tangible progress so far in the Geneva peace talks which are backed by 40 nations including Western powers Russia and China 
Diplomats expressing frustration warned privately that if the Syrian Government failed to move on humanitarian aid they would attempt to win Russian and Chinese backing for a new UN Security Council resolution About 130000 people have died and millions more displaced in three years of conflict Lakhdar Brahimi the UNs chief mediator said yesterday that he hoped to address the central matters separating the two sides the question of a political transition in Syria and the future of President Assad 
After yesterdays talks Mr Brahimi conceded that they havent produced much As fighting continued inside Syria it was reported yesterday that the deputy head of the alQaedalinked Islamic State of Iraq and Syria had been killed in fighting with another rebel faction"
