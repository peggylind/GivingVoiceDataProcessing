On Tuesday officials at Peshawar University said that ministers in the provincial government of KhyberPakhtunkhwa had forced them to cancel a ceremony to promote Ms Yousafzais memoir I Am Malala which relates her experiences as a schoolgirl advocating education for girls and surviving an attempted assassination by the Pakistani Taliban The book published last year is a best seller in the West but is not widely available in Pakistan especially in the conservative northwest Officials at the universitys Area Study Center where the event was to be held said they had come under pressure from the provincial government including Shah Farman the minister of information to cancel the event which was meant to formally introduce the book to the region The government said it could not provide the necessary security for the event 
Ms Yousafzai 16 was not scheduled to appear in person After she was shot in the head in 2012 she was flown to Britain for medical treatment and she and her family have since settled there The cancellation drew widespread criticism Even Imran Khan the national leader of one of the political parties that governs the province weighed in with dismay I am at a loss 2 understand why Malalas book launch stopped in Peshawar Mr Khan wrote on Twitter Using the initials for his party the Pakistan Justice Party he added PTI believes in freedom of speechdebate not censorship of ideas 
Mr Farman defended his actions The issue was of a suitable platform and security he said in a statement Malalas book is an autobiography and it has nothing to do with the Area Study Center or any educational institution for that matter The episode was the second this month in which Mr Khan found himself obliged to publicly criticize his partys officials in the region On Jan 12 he admonished the provincial government for refusing to acknowledge the bravery of a teenage boy who was killed trying to stop a suicide bomber at his school in Hangu
