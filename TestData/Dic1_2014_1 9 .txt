Rana Sanaullah the law minister of Punjab province and one of the closest confidants of the prime minister Nawaz Sharif told the Guardian the time had come to smash militant safe havens A spike in Talibanled violence has prompted a dramatic rethink in policy by a government long determined to avoid a confrontation with militant groups Expectations are growing of a longdelayed military push against alQaidalinked groups operating from North Waziristan on the Afghan border 
At a meeting this week of assembly members of the governing Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz PMLN a majority voted for such action Without eliminating terrorism and extremism we cannot place Pakistan on the fast track of development Sharif told the gathering The government has not said exactly what it plans to do leading some sceptics to doubt its resolve Sanaullah said a decision had been made to launch military operations but the army would be left to decide what form they would take 
Opposition politicians have warned that a draconian new antiterror law promulgated without parliamentary approval last week could turn the country into a police state Among the provisions of the Protection of Pakistan Ordinance PPO are secret courts greater shoottokill freedoms for the police house raids without warrants and the detention of terror suspects without charge for three months Sanaullah said This should have been done 10 years ago Even if it is 5 misused we must support it because without it there is no chance you can fight terrorists 
Pakistans law enforcement agencies have long been accused of illegally detaining missing persons for years on end and abusing prisoners in their custody I think what will be done will be no worse than what has happened in Guantanamo Bay Sanaullah said when asked about the risk of terror suspects being tortured Sanaullahs hardline stance comes after a year of studied inaction on terrorism by the PMLN which won a landslide victory in general elections in May The government has resisted pressure to unleash the army on a range of militant groups responsible for neardaily attacks on civilians religious minorities journalists polio vaccinators and the security forces 
Sharif has held firm to a policy of trying to negotiate with militants who last year were declared to be stakeholders in a potential peace process But a spate of deadly attacks in recent weeks on military targets by the TehreekeTaliban Pakistan has prompted the government to talk tough Last week the armed forces used jets and helicopter gunships to assault targets in North Waziristan which the army claimed were militant hideouts Sanaullah even offered a qualified defence of drones the CIAs unmanned attack aircraft which Pakistans politicians have publicly railed against for years We believe that drone attacks damage the terrorists very much he said 
Mustafa Qadri a Pakistan expert from Amnesty said with the PPO the government was creating some of the most repressive security laws in Pakistans history Sanaullah said rights groups were serving the cause of the Taliban This has to be enforced on a war footing he said"
