As the desire for peace has been expressed on the other side we want to forget the unpleasant past and give another chance to peaceful talks Mr Sharif said in a speech to Parliament in Islamabad the capital He urged the militants to stop their attacks during the peace process but offered no specifics about the talks The Pakistani Taliban said that its leadership would discuss Mr Sharifs proposal in a meeting in the next few days Though Mr Sharif and his party have previously said they favored peace talks his announcement took many by surprise Some senior government officials had indicated in recent days that the government was preparing for a military offensive and had been discussing an operational plan with senior military leaders 
After two recent attacks on security forces one in Bannu and one in Rawalpindi where the Pakistani military has its headquarters air force jets and army gunship helicopters mounted a rare retaliatory strike pounding militant hideouts in North Waziristan Mr Sharifs appearance in the lower house of Parliament on Wednesday was his first in six months and there had been speculation that he would announce additional military operations against the militants I think the principal reality that Pakistan is slowly coming to grips with is that no one really has any clue what Nawaz is thinking or which way he is leaning until he announces his decisions himself said Cyril Almeida an assistant editor at Dawn the countrys leading Englishlanguage daily newspaper 
A politician from the governing party speaking on the condition of anonymity said that although Mr Sharif was insistent on pursuing a dialogue the countrys powerful military remained determined to retaliate for any future terrorist attack The military establishment has decided to use force the politician said Talks and use of force will go side by side The fourmember commission announced by Mr Sharif includes three of his trusted aides and appeared to have been formed hastily It includes Irfan Siddiqui an influential newspaper columnist recently appointed as an a special assistant to the prime minister Muhammad Amir a retired army major and intelligence official Rahimullah Yusufzai a veteran journalist regarded as an expert on Taliban and Afghan affairs and Rustam Shah Mohmand a former Pakistani ambassador to Afghanistan 
Mr Yusufzai told local news media outlets that he was contacted by Mr Sharif on Wednesday morning and at first declined to take part Mr Mohmand said he learned of his inclusion in the commission from a news report Both men tried to hold down expectations It is very difficult to be optimistic in the current situation Mr Yusufzai said Asad Munir a retired army brigadier and a defense analyst said the commission was a nonstarter whose members lacked the expertise and influence to deal with the militants 
Mr Almeida noted the absence of prominent political figures and said Nawaz is essentially saying he doesnt have any faith in politicians to address the most vexing and critical problem facing the country"
